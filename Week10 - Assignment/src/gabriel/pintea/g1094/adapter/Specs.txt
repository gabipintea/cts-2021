Title:
`Design, Implementation and Practical Research on an open-source IoT Home Automation system`

Problem:
The system should integrate different devices from different vendors. For this example, a Philips HUE Smart Lightbulb
should be integrated, in such a way that it can be used as a generic light entity of the system, using the generic
methods for a light class entity.

Advantages:
- Intermediates the commands from the standard generic light entities to the specific vendor options.
- Does not change the interaction methods with every different vendors' devices, from the client perspective

Disadvantages:
- Every new integration needs a custom adapter to be implemented
- There is a possibility that some devices may not have a factory default correspondent for all the generic methods, or
maybe they have other features, which cannot be implemented yet
