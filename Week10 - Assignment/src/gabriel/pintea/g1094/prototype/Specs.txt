Title:
`Design, Implementation and Practical Research on an open-source IoT Home Automation system`

Problem:
The Home Automation is based on a variety of entities, like on/off switches (e.g. wall plugs, relays etc.),
lights (e.g. light bulbs, smart switches, lamps etc.), sensors (e.g. temp/humid, motion etc.). These entities
should share a common base, and should have a duplicate mechanism for fast creation and adding new devices,
based on the specifications of existing entities.

Advantages:
- Fast and low resource duplication of entities in the system

Disadvantages:
- None
