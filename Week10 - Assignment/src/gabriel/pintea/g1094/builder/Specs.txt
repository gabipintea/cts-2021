Title:
`Design, Implementation and Practical Research on an open-source IoT Home Automation system`

Problem:
The system must offer the user a way of defining automations, which may have totally different approaches, based on
multiple triggers, having conditions or not, performing different actions, having numerous attributes. The number of
elements and the way the automation is built must somehow be standardized. Also, a new feature of the system is the 
Blueprint section, which should give the users a more easier, convenient, semi-automated way of creating automations, 
with pre-defined automations, which should require just inputting the right entities.

Advantages:
- Clear way of building automations with lots of attributes, entity specific and also automation specific attributes,
but still offering a way of creating a new empty automation with just the required default attributes of an entity.

Disadvantages:
- None
