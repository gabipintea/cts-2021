Title:
`Design, Implementation and Practical Research on an open-source IoT Home Automation system`

Problem:
In a specific duration of time, any entity can change states, may be turned on/off, etc. It is not a good idea
to instantiate the entities everytime, containing all the attributes. A method of grouping and sharing the
entities and their attributes across manipulations, such as turning on/off, should be implemented.

Advantages:
- Using the Flyweight, the specific entities are mapped at the very first call of changing their states
- The entities may be also instantiated at the call moment for a state change
- The entities are shared with the system, no matter how many state changes are performed

Disadvantages:
- The Entity ids may change for different reasons, and that may conclude in some redundant, orphaned entities
in the Map. Some clearing method should be applied
