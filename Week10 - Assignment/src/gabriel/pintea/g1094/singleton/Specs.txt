Title:
`Design, Implementation and Practical Research on an open-source IoT Home Automation system`

Problem:
The main central Home Automation does need an `EVENTBUS` which must be accessed by different 
Smart Entities to send an event on the bus, or vice-versa to read different events on the bus
for triggering a variety of automations. The event bus allows any integration to fire or listen
for events. It is the core of everything.The event bus must be run only once and contain all 
the events, which are created. In order to keep the unique instance and offer access to the bus
a Singleton can be implemented, as a viable solution.

Advantages:
- Only one global instance is created
- Can be publicly accessed by any entity, either Smart Device or automation for read/write operations

Disadvantages:
- None
