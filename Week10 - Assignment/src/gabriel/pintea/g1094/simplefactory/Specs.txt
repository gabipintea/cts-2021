`Design, Implementation and Practical Research on an open-source IoT Home Automation system`

Problem:
For basic entity creation. there should be a default set of data for creating different entities, in a fast,
secure way. For developers, there is a testing sand-box, where one should have an easy method to create numerous
default entities of a specific type.

Advantages:
- Fast entity creation, for sand-boxing purposes, using default values, or as a fallback
- The required default data is entered and selected at runtime using correct data for specific entity types

Disadvantages:
- May create unwanted duplicates or orphaned entities
